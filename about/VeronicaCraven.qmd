## Education/Work Background
I am an office manager at an independent high school.
Prior to when I started here six years ago, I spent nine years in a college admissions office and three years working for a municipality. 
I have an AA in Liberal Arts and a BA in English.

## R experience
My R experiences is limited to DataCamp's Introduction to R course that I took last month in preparation for our work in this class.

## Research interests
My interests are in text analysis and data justice, particularly in the non-profit worlds of education/college access and local government.

## Hometown
I grew up in Framingham, MA, and now live in Chelmsford, MA.

## Hobbies
I enjoy reading, riding my bike, camping, board games, puzzles, and learning to play Magic the Gathering from my son. 

## Fun fact
Last summer I conquered a childhood fear. It's tradition to jump off the ferry wharf where we vacation in Maine and I was always too scared to join my cousins. This year I joined my cousins' children and finally took the leap!
